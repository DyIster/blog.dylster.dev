# Blog
Here you can find my open-sourced blog! I wanted to make a blog to discuss and talk about things that matter and hope that you enjoy using it.

## Usage
I don't really mind if you would like to use this. However you **must** give credits and not claim that you made it. You can do this by leaving a message at the bottom of the page.

Things not to do:
+ Use my avatar or branding
+ Claim on the site that you made the source code
+ Copy my articles from my published blog
+ Fail to change any aspect of the blog that you have been asked to change

Would like some help or want to query something? Join my [Discord](https://dylster.xyz/discord) or open a pull request/issue on this repository!
